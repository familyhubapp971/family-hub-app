// FHS-614: the guard the ticket asks for.

// FHS-613 added one money formatter; FHS-614 converted the ~39 screens that
// still glued a currency onto a number by hand. Nothing stops the 40th from
// appearing next week, and it would be invisible in review: "USD 7.50" reads
// fine to an English eye and is wrong for most of the world.
//
// So this walks the source and fails on the shapes that produce a hand-built
// money string. It is deliberately narrow: it looks for a currency token sat
// directly beside an amount, not for the words "currency" or "toFixed" on
// their own, so it does not nag about legitimate code.
