// FHS-633: the money sheets' choice lists scroll. Each row lifts a couple of
// pixels on hover and carries a hard offset shadow. A scroll box with no
// padding clips both, so the row's border and shadow were sliced off for as
// long as the pointer was on it.
//
// This is asserted on the class list rather than in a browser because clipping
// is a paint effect: jsdom has no layout, so a rendered test cannot see it.
// The rule it encodes is simple and durable: if a list scrolls, it must leave
// room on every side for what its rows draw outside themselves.
