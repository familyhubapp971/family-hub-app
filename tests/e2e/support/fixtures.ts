// FHS-516: reusable authenticated fixture for specs that need a signed-in
// family. Any future spec that needs an authed `/t/:slug/*` page imports
// `test`/`expect` from HERE (not from '@playwright/test' directly) and
// depends on the `authedFamily` fixture:
//
//   import { test, expect } from '../support/fixtures.js';

//     await page.goto(`/t/${authedFamily.slug}/members`);
//   });
//
// What it does, end to end:
//   1. Seeds a fresh, isolated tenant + admin user + child member + habit
//      directly in Postgres (support/auth/seed.ts), no signup flow, no
//      real email.
//   2. Mints an ES256 JWT for that user (support/auth/jwt.ts), signed with
//      the fixed test key the api trusts ONLY when E2E_TEST_JWKS is set
//      (see playwright.config.ts + apps/api/src/middleware/auth.ts).
//   3. Injects a supabase-js-shaped session into localStorage via
//      `context.addInitScript` (support/auth/session.ts), so it's already
//      there before the web app's first script runs: no UI login needed.
//   4. Tears the seeded family down after the test (support/auth/seed.ts).
//
// A test using this fixture can go straight to `page.goto('/t/<slug>/...')`
// already authenticated, exactly like a real signed-in user on a hard
// reload (session restored from localStorage).
