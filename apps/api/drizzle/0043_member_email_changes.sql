-- FHS-510 — admin-initiated sign-in email change for a grown-up member,
-- confirmed by a one-time emailed link.
--
-- Only the SHA-256 hash of the confirm token is stored (token_hash) — the raw
-- token is never persisted or logged. A row is single-use (used_at set on
-- consumption); a new request invalidates any prior pending row for the same
-- member (see the app code in routes/members.ts).
--
-- The confirm endpoint is PUBLIC (the recipient may not be signed in) and has
-- no tenant context to pin before it knows which tenant the token belongs to
-- — app_find_email_change() is a SECURITY DEFINER reader, same pattern as
-- app_claimable_invitations() in 0030_rls_read_path_functions.sql, scoped by
-- (member_id, token_hash) rather than tenant. Once the row is found the app
-- pins that tenant (pinRequestTenant) before any RLS-scoped write.

-- FHS-354-style SECURITY DEFINER reader — the confirm endpoint is public and
-- has no tenant pinned yet, so a plain SELECT would return zero rows under
-- RLS. Scoped to (member_id, token_hash): a caller must already hold the
-- high-entropy raw token (hashed client-side... no — server-side, before
-- comparing) to get a hit, so this does not widen the access boundary beyond
-- what the emailed link already grants.
