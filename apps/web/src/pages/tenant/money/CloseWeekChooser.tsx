/**
 * CloseWeekChooser: FHS-637
 *
 * The step the design puts in front of the five money actions when a parent
 * closes the week: what is on the table, one row per choice, then the button
 * that finishes the week.
 *
 * FHS-623 built the five flows but left this chooser out ("Closing a week
 * already exists"), so the My World board kept opening the old dialog and the
 * one screen between two redesigned ones stayed on the old look.
 *
 * Ported from `components/MoneyActions.tsx` in the Magic Patterns editor
 * (kudjspxd3xxroueg5jw11o). Deliberate deviations from that file:
 *   - money comes from the family's own currency via the shared formatter
 *     (FHS-614), not the mock's fixed helper;
 *   - the withdraw row hides when nothing is invested, which the design does
 *     too, but here it reads the live snapshot;
 *   - the old dialog's "Admin Mode Active" banner and its running "actions
 *     taken this session" list are gone. Founder decision, 2026-08-09: follow
 *     the design exactly. The banner unlocked nothing, and the design ends
 *     each action on its own "all done" screen instead of a running log.
