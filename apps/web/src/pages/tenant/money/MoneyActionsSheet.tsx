/**
 * MoneyActionsSheet: FHS-623
 *
 * Wires the FHS-622 seam (KidsMoneyPage's `onMoneyAction`) to the real
 * endpoints. A bottom sheet on a phone, a centred panel from tablet up
 * (Dialog's `align="bottom-sheet"`), one flow per action, each ending in a
 * "done" screen the family can read before it closes. Nothing here is
 * discarded on close: every confirm is a real POST, and a failure leaves
 * the sheet open with a plain-words error, never a silent no-op.
 *
 * FHS-637: it also opens on the design's "close the week" chooser, from the
 * My World board's Close Week button. FHS-623 left that step out on the
 * grounds that closing a week already existed, which left one old-looking
 * screen between two redesigned ones; the old dialog it deferred to is gone.
