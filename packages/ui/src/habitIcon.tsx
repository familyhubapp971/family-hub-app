// FHS-631: the API stores a habit's icon as a STRING NAME ("heart", "star"),
// never an emoji or a component. Anything that renders `habit.icon` directly
// prints the literal word, which is what the money sheets were doing: a habit
// row read "heart" in a grey box instead of showing an icon.
//
// This lived in apps/web/src/pages/tenant/kid/myworld/icons.tsx, out of reach
// of anything outside the kid pages, so the same bug was reintroduced in a new
// place (FHS-374 first, then FHS-630). It lives here now so there is one copy
// every screen can reach.
//
// The fallback is deliberate: an unknown or missing name gets a Star, never the
// raw string, so a new icon name added server-side can never leak text into the
// UI. `tests/unit/web/ui/habitIcon.test.tsx` fails if that stops being true.
