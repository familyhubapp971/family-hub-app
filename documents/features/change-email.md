# Feature: Change your own sign-in email

**Jira:** [FHS-510](https://qualicion2.atlassian.net/browse/FHS-510)
**Status:** shipped
**Owner:** product-manager

A grown-up can update their OWN sign-in email from Manage Members —
**self-serve only; nobody can change someone else's login email, admin or
not.** A one-time confirm link is emailed to the NEW address; the old
address keeps working until that link is clicked and the recipient
explicitly confirms. The OLD address is also notified — both when the
change starts and when it completes — so a silent account takeover isn't
possible. Clicking the link lands on a ConfirmEmail screen that applies the
change only after an explicit tap.

> **Pivot note (2026-07-31):** this feature originally shipped as an
> admin-changes-anyone flow. The founder reversed that design before wider
> rollout: a member may only ever change their own sign-in email. The
> backend now rejects any attempt to target another member's row
> (`apps/api/src/routes/members.ts`, `POST /api/members/:id/email-change`)
> with a 403, regardless of the caller's role. This doc reflects the
> shipped self-serve behaviour, not the original pitch.

## User stories

### Story 1: A member starts a change to their OWN email

**As a** signed-in grown-up (any role — admin, adult, teen)
**I want to** set a new sign-in email for MYSELF
**so that** my account moves to my current email address without losing
access in the meantime.

#### Acceptance criteria

**Scenario: A member sends a confirm link to their own new address**

- **Given** I am signed in and viewing Manage Members
- **And** my own card has a sign-in email and no change already pending
- **When** I choose "Change email" on MY OWN card and submit a new address
- **Then** a one-time confirm link is emailed to the NEW address
- **And** a heads-up notice (no action link) is emailed to my OLD address
- **And** my card shows "Confirm the new email" with the pending address
- **And** I can still sign in with my OLD email until the link is confirmed

**Scenario: The new address already belongs to another Family Hub account**

- **Given** I am on Manage Members, starting a change for my own email
- **When** I submit an email that is already registered to a different account
- **Then** the request is rejected
- **And** no confirm email is sent

**Scenario: A caller cannot start or cancel a change for ANOTHER member**

- **Given** I am signed in, admin or not
- **When** I attempt to start or cancel an email change for a member row that
  isn't my own
- **Then** the request is rejected with a 403 and nothing is written
- **And** this is true even for an admin targeting another admin's row

**Scenario: A member never sees another member's sign-in email or pending change**

- **Given** I am signed in as any role, viewing Manage Members
- **When** I view a card that isn't my own
- **Then** that member's sign-in email and any pending change are hidden from me
- **And** no "Change email" or pending-change controls are shown on their card
- **And** MY OWN card shows my real email + any pending change of my own

### Story 2: I confirm the new email I requested

**As the** grown-up who started their own email change
**I want to** open the link I was emailed and explicitly confirm it
**so that** my account starts using the new address, and a scanned or
prefetched link can never spend the confirmation on my behalf.

#### Acceptance criteria

**Scenario: Opening the link shows a confirm step, not an instant change**

- **Given** I started an email change for myself and received the confirm link
- **When** I open the link
- **Then** I land on a ConfirmEmail screen showing "Confirm your new email" and a button
- **And** nothing about my account has changed yet

**Scenario: Tapping confirm applies the change**

- **Given** I am on the "Confirm your new email" screen from a valid link
- **When** I tap "Confirm email change"
- **Then** the screen shows "Email updated" with my new sign-in email
- **And** a heads-up notice is emailed to my OLD address confirming the change
- **And** a "Back to the family" button returns me to the family

**Scenario: An expired, already-used, or cancelled link shows a clear message**

- **Given** the link has already been confirmed once, or 24 hours have passed, or I cancelled my own change
- **When** I tap "Confirm email change"
- **Then** I see "This link has expired" with no email address shown
- **And** nothing about my account is changed

**Scenario: A transient failure shows a retryable error, not "expired"**

- **Given** I am on the "Confirm your new email" screen from a valid, unexpired, unused link
- **When** I tap "Confirm email change" and a transient failure occurs (e.g. the Supabase
  update fails, or the local apply fails right after Supabase succeeds)
- **Then** I see "Something went wrong" with a "Try again" button
- **And** I am never told the link has expired for a failure that may still be retryable

### Story 3: I manage my own pending change

**As a** grown-up with a change already in flight
**I want to** resend or cancel MY OWN pending email change
**so that** I can recover from a typo or a change of mind before I confirm
the link.

#### Acceptance criteria

**Scenario: I resend my own confirm link**

- **Given** I have a pending email change of my own
- **When** I choose Resend on my own card
- **Then** a fresh one-time link is emailed to the same pending address
- **And** the previous link stops working

**Scenario: I cancel my own pending change**

- **Given** I have a pending email change of my own
- **When** I choose "Cancel change" on my own card
- **Then** the pending request is dropped
- **And** my card no longer shows a pending state
- **And** my sign-in email is unchanged

**Scenario: I cannot cancel someone else's pending change**

- **Given** another member has a pending email change
- **When** I attempt to cancel it
- **Then** the request is rejected with a 403 and their pending row is untouched

## Out of scope

- **An admin changing another member's email** — the original pitch for
  this ticket; reversed before rollout (see the pivot note above). An
  admin who wants to help a grown-up who's locked out still has to ask
  them to do it themselves, or reset their password via the normal
  Supabase auth recovery flow.
- Changing a kid's PIN-login identity — kids don't have a sign-in email
  (ADR 0009).
- Per-target throttling beyond the one-pending-change-per-member database
  constraint, drift monitoring/alerting on the rare Supabase-succeeded-but-
  local-apply-failed case, and revoking the target's other active sessions
  on a completed change — tracked as follow-ups, not blocking for v1.

## Open questions

- None outstanding.

## Success metrics

- Zero cross-member email changes — nobody can start, resend, or cancel a
  change for a row that isn't their own (verified by the single-use,
  hashed-token design + the self-serve `target.userId !== userRow.id` gate).
- Members can recover from a mis-typed new address without engineering
  support (Resend / Cancel cover it).
- Zero silent account takeovers — the OLD address always gets a signal
  (start + completion notices), so an unexpected change is always
  detectable by the person it happened to.
